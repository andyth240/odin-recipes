    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, combine all the marinade ingredients: soy sauce, fish sauce, lime juice, brown sugar, minced garlic, turmeric, cumin, coriander, paprika (optional), and vegetable oil. Mix well to form a smooth marinade.</li>
        <li>Cut the chicken breast or boneless chicken thighs into thin strips, about 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick.</li>
        <li>Place the chicken strips into the marinade, ensuring they are well coated. Cover the bowl and let the chicken marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour, or ideally, overnight for maximum flavor.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, prepare the peanut sauce. In a small saucepan over low heat, combine peanut butter, coconut milk, soy sauce, lime juice, brown sugar, sriracha sauce, and minced garlic. Stir well until the sauce is smooth and creamy. If needed, add a little water to adjust the consistency. Keep the sauce warm or reheat it before serving.</li>
        <li>Preheat your grill or grill pan over medium heat. If using wooden skewers, make sure they have been soaked in water for at least 30 minutes to prevent them from burning.</li>
        <li>Thread the marinated chicken strips onto the skewers, evenly distributing them. Leave a small gap between each piece to ensure even cooking.</li>
        <li>Place the skewers on the preheated grill and cook for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until the chicken is cooked through and has a nice char on the edges. Make sure to rotate the skewers for even cooking.</li>
        <li>Once the chicken is cooked, remove the skewers from the grill and let them rest for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve the chicken satay with the warm peanut sauce on the side. Garnish with chopped peanuts, fresh cilantro or parsley, and lime wedges, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
