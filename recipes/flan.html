    <p>Flan is a classic dessert that tantalizes the taste buds with its smooth, creamy texture and delightful caramel flavor. This recipe combines simple ingredients to create a luscious and indulgent treat that will satisfy any sweet tooth.</p>
    <p>The base of the flan consists of a rich custard made with eggs, milk, sugar, and vanilla extract. This mixture is gently cooked until it thickens and then poured into a caramel-coated mold. The magic happens when the flan is baked in a water bath, allowing it to slowly and evenly set while maintaining its velvety consistency. Once cooled and chilled, the flan is ready to be unmolded, revealing a glossy caramel glaze that cascades over the creamy custard. With its heavenly taste and elegant presentation, flan is a timeless dessert that never fails to impress and delight.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <p>For the caramel</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For the peanut sauce: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 can (14 ounces) sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
        <li>To prepare the caramel, place the granulated sugar and water in a small saucepan. Heat over medium-high heat, stirring gently until the sugar dissolves. Once the sugar has dissolved, stop stirring and allow the mixture to simmer. Keep a close eye on it, swirling the pan occasionally, until the mixture turns into a golden caramel color. Be careful as the caramel will be very hot. Immediately pour the caramel into a 9-inch round baking dish or individual ramekins, swirling the dish to coat the bottom evenly. Set aside and let the caramel cool and harden.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk the eggs until well beaten. Add the sweetened condensed milk, whole milk, and vanilla extract. Whisk everything together until fully combined and smooth.</li>
        <li>Pour the custard mixture over the hardened caramel in the baking dish or ramekins. Tap the dish or ramekins gently on the countertop to release any air bubbles that may have formed.</li>
        <li>Place the filled baking dish or ramekins into a larger roasting pan. Carefully pour hot water into the roasting pan until it reaches about halfway up the sides of the baking dish or ramekins. This water bath will help ensure even cooking and prevent the flan from curdling.</li>
        <li>Carefully transfer the roasting pan with the flan mixture into the preheated oven. Bake for approximately 45-50 minutes, or until the flan is set around the edges but still slightly jiggly in the center.</li>
        <li>Once done, remove the roasting pan from the oven and carefully take out the baking dish or ramekins from the water bath. Let the flan cool to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight, to allow the flan to fully set and develop its flavors.</li>
        <li>To serve, run a knife around the edges of the baking dish or ramekins to loosen the flan. Place a serving plate on top of the dish or ramekin and carefully invert it to release the flan. The caramel sauce will flow over the flan, creating a beautiful glaze.</li>
    </ol>
